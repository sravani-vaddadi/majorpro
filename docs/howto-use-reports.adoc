== How-to use JavaANPR reports

JavaANPR is not recognizing plates as it should?

In situations like these, the report generator can often help.
You can run it from the executable jar with
`java -jar javaanpr.jar -recognize -i path_to_your_image.jpg -o report_directory/`
or `mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="-recognize -i path_to_your_image.jpg -o report_directory/"`.

From the report (image courtesy of https://github.com/oskopek/javaanpr/issues/22[walterog19])

we can see that it (incorrectly) fixates on the brake lights,
instead of on the plate in such a sunny and bright image.
One solution is to crop them out (see image on the right).
JavaANPR then detects the plate "TSZ452" with a correct `syntax.xml` setting, which is almost correct.

As to what you can do about it generally (without cropping)
-- you could try some pre-processing, for example lessening the brightness,
normalizing the picture, etc...
For example, using a threshold filter for brightness 250-255,
I got the correct result:
(not saying this is what you want to do in general, it depends on the camera, lighting, ...)
